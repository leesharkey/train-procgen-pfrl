class DecoderNetwork(nn.Module):
    """Reconstructs and predicts agent-environment sequences.

    Generates a whole agent-environment sequence from a latent sample from the
    VAE. It contains a copy of the agent. The VAE is trained such that the
    decoder produces:
        - a sequence of observations
        - a sequence of rewards
        - a sequence of hidden states of the agent
        - a sequence of actions from the agent (and their log probabilities)
    that match as closely as possible the sequences that were actually observed
    in real roll outs of the agent-environment system.

    It uses a recurrent architecture to generate sequences of arbitrary length,
    so sequences longer than the training sequences may be generated if wanted.
    The recurrent architecture consists of an environment and an agent part:
    the agent part is the agent itself, which takes as input an observation
    of the (simulated) environment and its own hidden state. The environment
    part consists of several networks:
        - An EnvStepper, which has 'environment hidden state' which unrolls
          through time
        - An ObservationDecoder, which takes the environment hidden state and
          converts it into an observation for that timestep.
        - A RewardDecoder, which does the same for the reward that agent
          received at that timestep.
        - # TODO a DoneDecoder, which predicts whether the episode is done at
          that timestep.

    Since both the agent and the EnvStepper are recurrent, they require inputs
    to get the ball rolling. There are several networks that convert the latent
    VAE sample into the inputs required. Those are:
        - inithidden_network, which generates the initial hidden state of the
          agent. We don't need to produce later hidden states, because the
          agent does that itself.
        - env_init_network, which generates the initial hidden state of the
          EnvStepper.
